    <h3>Chapter25 SHELL COTTAGE</h3>

    <p style="margin-top:45px;">"Who is it?" Bill called.</p>
    <p>  "It is I, Remus John Lupin!" called a voice over the howling<br>
    wind. Harry experenced a thrill of fear; what had happened? <br>
    "<u>I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks,</u> and you, the Secret-<br>
    Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the addresss and bade me come in<br>
    an emergency!"</p>
    <p>"Lupin," muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wenched it<br>
    open.</p>
    <p>Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in<br>
     a traveling cloak, his graying hair windswept. He straightened up,<br>
    looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried<br>
    aloud, <strong>"It's a boy! We've named him Ted, after Dora's father!"</strong><br>
      Hermione shrieked.</p>
    <p>"Wha-? Tonks- Tonks has had the baby?"<br>
    "Yes, yes, she's had the baby!" shouted Lupin.<br></p>
